*Android Reddit App Project*

In order for this to work you must create a reddit.properties file in ./app/src/main/assets/ with the following:

```
clientID= (your reddit application client ID)
platform= (your platform name, probably "android" since this is an android app)
appID= (your app id, such as com.example.redditapp)
version= (your app version id, such as 1.0)
name= (your reddit username)
```
